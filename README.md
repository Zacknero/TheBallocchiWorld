# TheBallocchiWorld

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8 and updated into version 8.0.0. Now is not supported at 8 version

I have implemented:
- Basic Folder Structure
- Guard
- Interceptor (Authentication and Errors) 
- Firebase for Login
- Menu Routing with Login, child Login (First Page), Admin Page and Logout

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
